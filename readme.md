# No Man is An Island

　　No man is an island,
　　Entire of itself;
　　Every man is a piece of the continent,
　　A part of the main.
　　If a clod be washed away by the sea,
　　Europe is the less,
　　As well as if a promontory were,
　　As well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were:
　　Any man's death diminishes me,
　　Because I am involved in mankind,
　　And,
　　Therefore,
　　Never send to know for whom the bells tolls;
　　It tolls for thee.
